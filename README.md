# Calculator App
This Python script uses the Kivy framework to create a simple calculator app with a text input widget and a grid of buttons for input. It can handle basic arithmetic operations and clear the input. The app also sets an icon.

# Requirements
To run this app, you will need to have Python installed, as well as the following libraries:

Kivy
You can install Kivy using pip:
pip install kivy

Also note that depending on the version of python installed latest kivy module 2.1.0 might not work on Python version 3.11.0

# Usage
To run the app, navigate to the directory where the script is saved and enter the following command in your terminal:
python calculator.py

The app will then open and you can use the buttons to perform calculations.
